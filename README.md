# pyITA
PyITA (Python Implementation of Taylor expansion for Aenet) is an implementation of the Cooper et al. first order Taylor expansion-based data augmentation technique for improving training efficiency.

Note:

This is a program that I wrote for a paper I authored in high school. The code is no longer maintained, and only available here for reference purposes.

If you would like to use it to perform taylor expansion-based augmentation in your Aenet training flow, it *should*  still work, but I PROVIDE NO GUARANTEES as this code is no longer maintained.
